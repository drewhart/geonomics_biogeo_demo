# TODO

- add instructional content (images, explanations, questions)
- clean up the barrier example and add a local adaptation example (or something else?)
- figure out (w/ Keeley at BIDS) how best to host the code for the students' use
- clean up/finalize this file
- check if seed number is working right!
- add the genetic PCA plotting function to the package?

# Suggested questions

- How might a species' dispersal ability determine the effect of a barrier on genetic relatedness?
- Should local adaptation to an environmental gradient influence genetic relatedness? If so, how?
